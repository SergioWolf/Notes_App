# Notes_App
Educational project
Task conditions
Develop a note-taking app. It should work as follows:

The application allows you to create, delete and edit notes at the user's request. Each note has a title and text inside.
By default, the app displays all the user's notes in order from shortest to longest.
Additionally, the application has the ability to sort all the user's notes from the longest to the shortest.
The application handles errors, meaning it is fault tolerant. If the user input is incorrect, the application informs the user about it.
Create functions for each note operation, as well as a general function that controls the operation of the application.
